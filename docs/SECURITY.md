Security controls include:

- Role-based access model across admin, accountant, consultant, and customer roles.
- OTP-driven authentication touchpoints via SMS provider integration.
- Input validation and server-side authorization checks on protected actions.
- Controlled database read boundaries for WooCommerce-linked data.
- Operational secrets (keys, tokens, webhook endpoints) excluded from version control.

Only client-safe documentation is published in this repository.
